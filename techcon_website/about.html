            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Since its inception, TechCon has grown from a small gathering of tech enthusiasts into one of the most anticipated 
                technology conferences worldwide. The idea for TechCon began in 2010, when a group of visionaries, driven by their 
                passion for technology and innovation, recognized the need for a platform that would bring together experts from 
                various tech fields to share ideas, showcase new developments, and shape the future of the industry.</p>
            <h3>Early Beginnings (2010â€“2013)</h3>
             <p>TechCon's first event was held in a modest venue, with fewer than 100 participants. It was created to provide a 
                collaborative environment where developers, engineers, and technologists could discuss emerging technologies 
                like cloud computing and mobile app development, which were in their infancy at the time. Despite its 
                humble beginnings, the first TechCon sparked intense interest, thanks to its hands-on workshops, product 
                demonstrations, and inspiring talks by early tech pioneers.</p>
